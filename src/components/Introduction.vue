                I got started writing software back in 2017 as a backend, then
                slowly moved around the stack until i fell in love with DevOps
                and Cloud development.

            <p class="tw-text-lg">
                I've built products for the maritime sector, robotics for
                hospitals and mentored teams across domains.

                I do both Freelance and fulltime employment, and love working
                remotely. Technology empowers so many to do so much, and I love
                being part of the journey.
